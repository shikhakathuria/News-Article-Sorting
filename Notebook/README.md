# News Article Sorting

### Abstract:

In today's digital era, the vast influx of online news sources necessitates efficient categorization to meet the increasing demand for accessible and relevant information. This project presents a machine learning model designed to classify news articles into five distinct categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport, or tech. Leveraging a labeled dataset comprising 1490 articles from the BBC, various algorithms are employed for prediction, with most achieving an accuracy exceeding 90%. Particularly noteworthy is the performance of the Complement Naive Bayes algorithm, which boasts impressive precision (over 95%), recall (over 98%), and f1-score (over 97%) across all categories, culminating in an overall accuracy of 98%.

### Problem Statement:

In todayâ€™s data-driven landscape, organizations harness the power of analytics to derive actionable insights, with news article classification serving as a prime example. The proliferation of online news sources has led to an overwhelming volume of content, necessitating effective classification to facilitate swift and targeted information retrieval for users. By implementing machine learning models for automated news classification, untapped topics can be identified, and personalized recommendations can be tailored based on users' preferences.

### Solution:

Utilizing a publicly available dataset comprising 1490 articles from the BBC, this project employs a range of algorithms for prediction, each yielding accuracies surpassing 90%. Notably, the Complement Naive Bayes algorithm stands out for its exceptional performance metrics, boasting precision, recall, and f1-scores exceeding 95%, 98%, and 97% respectively across all categories, resulting in an overall accuracy of 98%.
